### Design: 1/3

Graph building should not be in Dijkstra's.

Graph and Path classes should be generic.

### Documentation & Specification (including JavaDoc): 1/3

DijkstrasPaths documentation doesn't make much sense. What does "a list of maps such that we either have no path or we can find the minimum path by going through the list" mean?

### Code quality (code and internal comments including RI/AF when appropriate): 2/3

Returning this.buildings directly is rep exposure.

### Testing (test suite quality & implementation): -/3

### Mechanics: 3/3

#### Overall Feedback

The first step here is to make your Graph class generic.

#### More Details

None.
