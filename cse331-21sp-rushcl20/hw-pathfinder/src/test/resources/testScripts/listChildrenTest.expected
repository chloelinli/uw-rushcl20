created graph childGraph
added node A to childGraph
added node B to childGraph
added node C to childGraph
added node D to childGraph
added edge 1.000 from A to B in childGraph
added edge 3.000 from A to C in childGraph
added edge 10.000 from A to D in childGraph
the children of A in childGraph are: B(1.000) C(3.000) D(10.000)
