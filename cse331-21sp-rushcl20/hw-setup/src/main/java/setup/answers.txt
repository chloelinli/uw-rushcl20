1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Fibonacci originally failed test because the condition was for if n<=0, but the test was looking for
if a negative number (i.e. n<0) was input. In order to fix this, I deleted the equals (=) sign in the
condition.

2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Fibonacci failed the base case test because it returned 1 for any n<=2 that skipped the exception. However,
the 0th and 1st indices were to return 1, while the 2nd index returned 1+1 -> 2, so to fix this I changed
the 2 to a 1 in the condition, i.e. n<=1.

3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Fibonacci failed the recursive case because it was subtracting rather than adding the previous two
Fibonacci numbers, so to fix this I changed the minus sign (-) to a plus sign (+) in the return statement.

Notes:
Added Comparator to Ball.java
-> public class Ball "implements Comparator<Ball>"" {
->  /**
     * override method
     * @param b1 ball 1 to compare to ball 2
     * @param b2 ball 2
     * @return comparison result (+ for b2, - for b1, 0 if same)
     */
    public int compare(Ball b1, Ball b2) {
        return (int) (b1.getVolume() - b2.getVolume());
    }
